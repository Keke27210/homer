# Donations
If you enjoy Homer, please consider donating. I (iDroid) am a French student who develops Homer during my free time but unfortunately I cannot afford 100% reliable and powerful hosting.  
Even if I can always find a way to keep Homer alive, it is not a stable solution. Just $5 a month would help me to rent a powerful machine for Homer's prosperity.  
Donators get cool perks such as higher audio quality, customizable telephone numbers and much more: if you are interested, just send `h:donate` to Homer in DMs and follow instructions.

# Support place

Support is available in English, French and German.
