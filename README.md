[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/305277118105911296.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/305277118105911296)

## Introduction
Homer is an all-in-one Discord bot designed for all communities. It was born in April 2017 under the name *iBot*.  
The bot uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) as API wrapper and runs on the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) runtime engine.  
**Note:** I do not provide ***any*** help for self-hosting.  

## Main features
- Moderation (basic actions with a modlogging).
- Utility commands (getting information about content, searching for stuff on Google, ...).
- Easy-to-use profile to share your social networks and a personnal reminder because you must not forget what you wanted to do a minute ago!
- An advanced poll system with customizable choices, emotes and duration.
- Translated into multiple languages : English and French. Yes ok it's not a lot but if you wanna get it in your language you can start translating ^_^ (see GitHub).
- A telephone, yes, get your number and start calling people around Discord (*note: they must have the bot and set-up the telephone, of course*). *Notice: we transmit your calls to the NSA by the way... no jk*
- A dashboard where you can check the latest news about the bot and soon make some cool stuff from here (still in development).

## Important notice
To avoid overload due to bot collections, a purge is executed every week. If your guild does not fit the following requirements:
- 5 minimum members (human accounts)
- maximum 60% of bots

the bot will leave your guild.

## Note
If you ever looked into blargbot's source code, you might see that the file organization is almost the same and that's normal : I didn't have any idea about how I could manage all this shit so I took example on Rastimal's work ^_^
