# Homer

## Introduction
Homer is a Discord bot with uncommon features such as a phone or a real radio! Of course, it also includes the essentials so that you don't miss any information.  
The project was born in April 2017 under the name iBot. After a number of redesigns, the name Homer was chosen by the community.  
In April 2020, an umpteenth redesign took place to focus only on the essentials and provide a complete and seamless user experience.  
As a result, the bot is now more reliable and responsive.

## Self-hosting
