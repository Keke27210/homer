# Translating Homer

## Introduction
Hey,  
Thank you for wanting to translate Homer into your language.  
I really appreciate it and it can bring people who do not speak English well.  
All languages are accepted, even Chineese (Traditional)!  
If you have found something wrong in an **existing** translation, feel free to create a pull request in order  
to fix this issue.  
  
Thank you :heart:

## How do I translate
First, start forking the repository using the "Fork" button at the top-right.  
Then, you must copy the content of `en-gb.json` that you can find in `src/Production/Locales`.  
After that, create a file using the following syntax: `locale-country.json` and paste what you just copied inside it.  
Finally, start translating Homer by editing English with your language!

## Important notice
- Please only touch to the **right side** of lines (`something.else.here` must be kept as they are).  
- Revamp sentences if you need to, they must sound human and not robot-processed.  
- Respect Mustache syntax, do not touch to `{{{` `}}}` and what's inside, you can move them in the sentence yet.
