# Translations

## Rules
- Be rigorous in the target language.
- Respect the original translation.
- Do not leave variables out of functions.

## Instructions
- Fork this repository
- Browse to `/src/locales` and create a file `<code>.js` with *code* the target language code
- Copy the content of `en-gb.js` into this new file
- Replace the header with information about your language.
  > If you create the file, insert your Discord ID in the `authors` array. If it already exists, add it after the existing IDs.
- Start translating!

## Review
Once you estimate your work completed, you can submit the translation file by opening a pull request.  
It will be left open for some time to allow other natives to comment on your work and propose an improved version if necessary.
