# Contributing guide

## Purpose
Any contribution must have a defined purpose and must respond to a genuine need.  
Therefore, do not propose contributions unless you are certain of their relevance.  
You will also need to have tested your version on an unofficial instance. Invalid contributions will be rejected.

## Linting
This project uses linting rules to ensure that the entire code is consistent in its syntax.  
You must absolutely configure the linter with the parameters present in **[.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json)**, otherwise your contribution will be rejected.

## Review
All contributions are subject to revision where they may be commented and criticized.  
It is up to the author to make the necessary corrections if any.
